1. Tumbling windows that count the total number of ratings that each movie has received.

3. Hopping Window : program that monitors a stream of temperature readings and detects when the temperature consistently drops below 45 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of 10 minutes.

4. Sliding Window :  Time series records, to create windowed aggregations with small increments in time. This example uses hopping windows, but hopping windows aren't the best solution with small time increments. This example to show how  efficient windowed aggregations with small advances in time.
