# Streams Join Tables ( N Way )

Here are some hands-on labs to demonstrate how streams and tables can be joined using ksqlDB.


This lab is broken into INNER Join and LEFT Join.

Both the examples start with 1 Streams join 1 table and ends with 1 Stream joining 2 Tables.


Here is the official documentation for Joins [Joins in ksqlDB](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/joins/).
